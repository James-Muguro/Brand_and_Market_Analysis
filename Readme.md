# Brand and Market Analysis Project

## Purpose

The Brand and Market Analysis project is designed to offer a detailed examination of brand and market performance, allowing businesses to make informed decisions based on key metrics. By leveraging various models and visualizations, the project aims to uncover patterns, correlations, and efficiency benchmarks within the retail landscape.

## Project Contents

### 1. Key Metrics
   - **Brand Performance:** Total and average sales volume and net sales for each brand.
   - **Supermarket Performance:** Total and average sales volume and net sales for each supermarket.
   - **Other Stores Performance:** Total and average sales volume and net sales for each client type.
   - **Discount Impact:** Correlation between discounts and sales volume for each brand and supermarket.
   - **Cost Efficiency:** Ratio of total costs (COGS, distribution, and warehousing) to net sales for each brand and supermarket.
   - **Product Preference:** Most and least popular product size or pack for each brand and supermarket.

### 2. Key Questions Answered
   - Brand Ranking
   - Supermarket Influence
   - Discount Analysis
   - Cost-Effective Operations
   - Product Size Preferences

### 3. Visualizations
   - **Brand Performance Visualization:** Graphical representation of brand-specific metrics.
   - **Client Performance Visualization:** Visualize the performance of different client types.
   - **Discount Impact Visualization:** Illustrate the correlation between discounts and sales volume.
   - **Cost Efficiency Visualization:** Present the cost efficiency of brands and stores.

### 4. Models
   - **Linear Regression Model:** Understand the relationship between discounts, costs, and sales.
   - **Time Series Analysis:** Identify seasonal patterns or trends in sales.
   - **Clustering Model:** Group sales based on cost efficiency.
   - **Decision Tree Regression Model:** Predict net sales for each brand.
   - **Random Forest Regressor:** Predict volume for each combination of brand and client type in the test set.

### 5. Value Proposition
The project serves retail businesses aiming to optimize brand and supermarket performance.
Data analysts and data scientists can leverage the models and visualizations for actionable insights.
